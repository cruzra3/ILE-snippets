      * In this example, an array of customer information actually consists
      * of several subarrays. You can search either the main array or the
      * subarrays overlaying the main array.

     D I               S              4  0 Inz(1)
     D custData        S                   like(cust)
     D custName        S             30    Inz('RAFAEL')
     D custInfo        DS
     D cust                                DIM(100)
     D name                          30A   OVERLAY(cust : *NEXT)
     D id_number                     10I 0 OVERLAY(cust : *NEXT)
     D amount                        15P 3 OVERLAY(cust : *NEXT)

      * You can search for a particular set of customer information
      * by doing a search on the "cust" array

     C     custData      LOOKUP    cust(i)                                10

      * You can search on a particular field of the customer information
      * by doing a search on one of the overlay arrays

     C     custName      LOOKUP    name(i)                                11

      * After the search, the array index can be used with any of the
      * overlaying arrays. If the search on name(i) is successful,
      * the id_number and amount for that customer are available
      * in id_number(i) and amount(i).

     C                   EVAL      *INLR = *ON
