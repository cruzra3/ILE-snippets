      * Define a Multiple Occurrence data structure of 20 elements with:
      * -- 3 fields of character 20
      * -- A 4th field of character 10 which overlaps the 2nd
      * field starting at the second position.
      *
      * Named constant 'Max_Occur' is used to define the number of
      * occurrences.

      * Absolute notation (using begin/end positions)
