Fixed-format Eval with a long expression:
     C              Eval     New_Amount = ((FieldA +
     C                       FieldB) * FieldC)
     C                       / (FieldD + FieldE)

Equivalent in free format, making better use of space:
      /free
       New_Amount =((FieldA+FieldB)*FieldC/(FieldD+FieldE);
      /end-free


"If" logic in fixed format:
     C              If      Month = June and Moon = Full
     C              If      Amount_due > *zero
     C              Eval    Special_discount = .13
     C              Else
     C              Eval    Special_discount = .07
     C              Endif
     C              Endif

Equivalent in free format:
      /free
       If Month = June and Moon = Full;
         If Amount_due > *zero;
           Special_discount = .13;
         Else;
           Special_discount = .07;
         Endif;
       Endif;
      /end-free
