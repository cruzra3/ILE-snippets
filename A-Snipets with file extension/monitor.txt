      * *PROGRAM Handles all program-error status codes, from 00100 to 00999
      * *FILE Handles all file-error status codes, from 01000 to 09999
      * *ALL Handles both program-error and file-error codes, from 00100 to
      *  09999. This is the default.

      * The MONITOR block consists of the READ statement and the IF
      * group.
      * - The first ON-ERROR block handles status 1211 which
      * is issued for the READ operation if the file is not open.
      * - The second ON-ERROR block handles all other file errors.
      * - The third ON-ERROR block handles the string-operation status
      * code 00100 and array index status code 00121.
      * - The fourth ON-ERROR block (which could have had a factor 2
      * of *ALL) handles errors not handled by the specific ON-ERROR
      * operations.
      *
      * If no error occurs in the MONITOR block, control passes from the
      * ENDIF to the ENDMON
