      * Move the job date to LOGONDATE. By default, LOGONDATE has an *ISO
      * date format, which contains a 4-digit year. *DATE also contains a
      * 4-digit year, but in a different format, *USA.

      * Extract the month from a date field to a 2-digit field
      * that is used as an index into a character array containing
      * the names of the months. Then extract the day from the
      * timestamp to a 2-byte character field which can be used in
      * an EVAL concatenation expression to form a string.
      * For example, if LOGONDATE is March 17, 1996, LOGMONTH will
      * contain 03, LOGDAY will contain 17, and DATE_STR will contain
      * 'March 17'.
