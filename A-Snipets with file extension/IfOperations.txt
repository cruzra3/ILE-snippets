      // group is true. If the group is true, the next
      // part of the expression is checked. If this
      // expression is also true, the If resolves to true.

      // Now consider the same expression without the
      // parentheses:

      If  Acctbal > 1000 or Status = 'A'
                       and Date_1 > Date_2;

      // This time, with no parentheses, the "and" has the
      // highest precedence, so the Status check is now
      // paired with the date comparison. If Acctbal is
      // greater than 1000, the entire If is true; if
      // false, both the Status check and the date
      // comparison must be true.
