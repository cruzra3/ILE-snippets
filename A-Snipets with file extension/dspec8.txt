      * Example 2:
      * This data structure is explicitly based on the *LDA using
      * the DTAARA keyword. Since it is not a data area data
      * structure, it must be handled using IN and OUT operations.
      *
     D LDA_DS          DS                  DTAARA(*LDA)
     D SUBFLD                  1    600A
     C                   IN        LDA_DS
     C                   OUT       LDA_DS
     C                   Eval      *InLr = *On
